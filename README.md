# Udacity Data Analyst Term 1 Project: Investigate a Dataset (TMDb movie data)
This project is part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

## Project Overview
In this project I go through data analysis process steps which are:

I have answered the following Questions:

The libaraies that I used in this notebook are:
* pandas 
* matplotlib
* numpy 

**You can go through the tmdb-movie-data-analysis.ipynb file and see how the questions have been answered, and what conclusions have been drawn**
